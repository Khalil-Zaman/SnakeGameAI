Install the necessary modules, and run to play the famous traditional snake game

mysnakeAI.py
My Snake game consists a rectangular grid of a 100 squares. Given what's on each square, feed the data
into the Snake Neural Networks.

Starting with an initial population of 25 snakes, select the best 10 (based on their fitness) to breed. A mutation rate
dictates how likely it is for a weight to be changed by some random value between (-1, 1).

I save the "brains" of the snake into files that I can load back up when running again.

Currently, the AI's don't do anything impressive, I'm just trying to get them to turn left at some point.
